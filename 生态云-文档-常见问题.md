# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Which browsers does Eco Cloud support?

At present, the PC version of the Eco Cloud is adapted for Chrome and Firefox, while the mobile phone version is adapted for Chrome. We will increase browser support in the future.

### 2. What is the difference between the "KSYun-Beijing6" and "AWS-Beijing" areas?

#### KSYun-Beijing 6

Taking into consideration factors such as manufacturer support, business development, and operating costs, it is recommended that Ecosystem enterprises deploy their domestic operation in KSYun-Beijing6. This area has unique user management and User Portrait (Big Data) capabilities, and there is a network connection between the Xiaomi Room and KSYun. The Mi Smart Home MIOT system is only deployed in the Xiaomi Room. If you need to transmit data from MIOT to FDS (Xiaomi Room or AWS) and have greater requirements for network transmission, it is recommended that you use the AppEngine of KSYun-Beijing 6 and the Xiaomi Room FDS.

#### AWS-Beijing

When Ecosystem enterprises are not reliant on MIOT, or have non-real-time services that require low network transmission from MIOT to AWS FDS, in the case of high reliance on Database and Redis/Memcached, it is recommended that the system be deployed in the AWS-Beijing area (such as AppEngine, FDS, etc.).

### 3. What are the benefits of using self-service Database and Redis/Memcached services?

#### More efficiency

Users can create and delete databases or caches through the interface, without the need for waiting for manual processing.

#### More flexibility

After the database or cache is created, it can be bound to the user's applications. Applications can use the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable to obtain connection information for Database or Redis/Memcached, avoiding the need for coding and increasing flexibility.

#### More secure

Applications can use the VCAP_SERVICES environmental variables to obtain certain sensitive information such as the Database password. As a result, this sensitive information does not need to be included within the code, increasing the security of the code.

The database/cache subnets for different users are isolated, and applications can only access databases/caches belonging to their own Org, ensuring data security through the network layer.

### 4. How to control an application's extranet accessï¼Ÿ

Select a different domain name. In the KSYun Room and AWS Room, use domain names to resolve extranet and intranet access. If you prohibit extranet access, place it under a private domain name or under a public domain name. Both public and private domain names can be set through security groups.

### 5. What is the time zone for the AppEngine?

The time zone is always UTC, whether it is deployed domestically or overseas.

### 6. What alert services does the Eco Cloud provide for users?

Eco Cloud provides two different alert services for users:

* Applications deployed in the Eco Cloud AWS environment and resources under AWS sub-accounts can directly create CloudWatch email alerts.
* Regarding alerts for applications deployed in the Eco Cloud KSYun environment, please contact the Eco Cloud team to configure your SMS alerts.
