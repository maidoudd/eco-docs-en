# User Management

## Overview

User management includes the management of users, user groups, and roles.  

- Users need to be associated with specific user groups to be able to log on to the Eco Cloud and control relevant resources. 
- A user group contains all of the resources on the Eco Cloud and can also grant permissions. 
- A role is a collection of permissions, including service permissions such as the AppEngine on the Eco Cloud and User Portrait. Binding a role to a specific user group can control the user group's access to these resources.

Before you use the AppEngine to deploy the application, you need to add the SpaceDeveloper permission for the Space corresponding to the user group.   
Before you use User Portrait, you need to add BIGDATA ACCESS_ALLO permissions to the user group.
