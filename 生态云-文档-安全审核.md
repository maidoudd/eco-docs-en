# Security Audits

## Objective

For Mi Ecosystem products, avoid serious user privacy and data security issues during the beta stage and following official release.

## Focus

Data acquisition, storage, transmission, and access control. If you use non-Ecosystem enterprise products and cloud services, please specify (such as Xiaomi File Storage Service, Aliyun database services, Ksyun Virtual Machine, Xiaomi accounts, Xiaomi cloud service Micloud, Mi Smart Home MIOT/MIIO, etc.)

## Process

New products are submitted for audit prior to beta testing. Beta testing can start when the audit is approved (any serious problems must be corrected). New products must undergo machine testing prior to crowdfunding or sale. They can be released onto the market when the audit is approved (any serious problems must be corrected).

## Background

In 2015, we found security and privacy issues in a number of new Ecosystem enterprise products. Starting from 2016, Xiaomi must be contacted for routine data security audits and prototype testing prior to the beta testing of all new Ecosystem enterprise products. Previously released products will be audited in due course. Depending on the actual situation of the product, we may spend a lot of time conducting several audits at different stages, or we may just carry out a single audit.
