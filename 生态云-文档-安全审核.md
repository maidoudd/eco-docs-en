# Security Audits

## Objective

For Mi Ecosystem products, we conduct security audits to help avoid serious user privacy and data security issues during the beta testing stage and following official release.

## Focus

Data acquisition, storage, transmission, and access control. If you are using products and cloud services from non-Ecosystem enterprises, please specify the information. (such as MI File Storage Service, Aliyun database services, Ksyun Virtual Machine, Mi Accounts, Mi Cloud, Mi Smart Home MIOT/MIIO, etc.)

## Process

The security documents of new products should be submitted for security audit prior to beta testing stage. Beta testing can start when the audit is approved (any serious problems must be rectified). Engineering machine of new products should be provided for security testing and analysis prior to crowdfunding or sale. They can be released to the market only after the audit is approved (any serious problems must be rectified).

## Background

In 2015, we found security and privacy issues in a number of new Mi Ecosystem enterprise products. Starting from 2016, Xiaomi must be contacted for routine security audits and prototype testing prior to the beta testing of all new Ecosystem enterprise products. Previously released products will be audited in due course. Depending on the actual situation of the product, we may spend a lot of time conducting several audits at different stages, or we may just carry out a single audit.
